TODO
----

[x] Move [Manual|Autonomous] switch to dashboard
[x] Move Scenario box to left side and add play/pause button and replace restart button with restart icon
[x] Switch to manual mode on gas/brake/steer keyboard input
[x] Fix not-enough-road-left-for-spatial-horizon bug; just plan until the end of the road then full brake (with dynamic obstacles too)
[x] Hide dynamic obstacles that aren't before station 0
[x] Catch finalized scenarios with no points; just do nothing instead of starting the planner
[x] Ability to add obstacles to scenario in editor
[x] Scenario info like road length, number of obstacles, etc.
[x] Hook up clear path/obstacle/all button in editor
[x] Dynamic obstacles with dynamic obstacle grid gpgpu program
[x] Separate collision/hazard dilations for dynamic obstacles
[?] Weird bug where lattice isn't shifted (maybe more than one station point is passed)
[x] Static obstacle rotation
[ ] README
[x] Two-lane roads? (Could be as easy as doubling the default lane width and having the desired latitude at +/- half lane width instead of 0)
[ ] Save/load scenarios (maybe use querystring so that scenarios can be easily shared)
[?] Add compass to dashboard
[ ] On pause, show more detailed planner results (maybe top 10/100? best trajectories)
[?] Configurable geolocation
[ ] Collision detection (full stop or pause?)
[ ] Obstacle tossing during simulation
[ ] Toggles to show/hide simulation components (planned path, lattice, current curvature?, obstacle cost maps, velocity profile?)
[x] Try optimizing graph search by continuing early if cost already exceeds best trajectory cost
[x] Max top-down zoom out
[x] Try to add offset to obstacle detection (obstacles are dilated from the center of the vehicle, but the rear axle is the point that is checked for collision costs)
[ ] Help dialogs/instructions
[ ] Fix memory leaks with geometry/material/texture disposal
[x] Scenario starting speed and scenario-dependent speed limit
[ ] Ability to change speed limit and lane preference during simulation
