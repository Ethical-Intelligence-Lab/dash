TODO
----

[x] Move [Manual|Autonomous] switch to dashboard
[x] Move Scenario box to left side and add play/pause button and replace restart button with restart icon
[x] Switch to manual mode on gas/brake/steer keyboard input
[ ] Fix not-enough-road-left-for-spatial-horizon bug; just plan until the end of the road then full brake
[x] Catch finalized scenarios with no points; just do nothing instead of starting the planner
[x] Ability to add obstacles to scenario in editor
[ ] Scenario info like road length, number of obstacles, etc.
[x] Hook up clear path/obstacle/all button in editor
[x] Dynamic obstacles with dynamic obstacle grid gpgpu program
[?] Separate collision/hazard dilations for dynamic obstacles
[?] Weird bug where lattice isn't shifted (maybe more than one station point is passed)
[ ] README
[ ] Two-lane roads? (Could be as easy as doubling the default lane width and having the desired latitude at +/- half lane width instead of 0)
[ ] Save/load scenarios
[?] Add compass to dashboard
[ ] On pause, show more detailed planner results
[?] Configurable geolocation
