Make sure hardware acceleration is enabled.

Chrome
------
* Works on both Windows and Mac with this flag:
    chrome://flags#enable-experimental-canvas-features (necessary for OffscreenCanvas planning in WebWorker)
* chrome://flags#enable-zero-copy (may slightly increase performance)

Firefox
-------
 * Must enable in about:config: gfx.offscreencanvas.enabled
 * Windows: crashes the tab when running the planner
 * Mac: simulates and runs the planner fine, but FPS is way lower than Chrome

Safari
------
 * WebGL doesn't even work on Safari 11.0.3 with macOS High Sierra (10.13.3)
 * Safari Technology Preview works, but OffscreenCanvas isn't supported so planner doesn't work

iOS Chrome and Safari
---------------------
 * WebGL seems to work, but no planner since OffscreenCanvas isn't supported
